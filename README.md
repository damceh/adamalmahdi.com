# Adam Almahdi's Portfolio

My personal portfolio website where I showcase my work in IT and performance marketing. Built this to have a clean, professional presence online that actually represents who I am.

## About This Site

This is my digital space where potential clients and collaborators can learn about my background, see my work, and get in touch. I wanted something that loads fast, looks good on mobile, and doesn't feel like every other portfolio out there.

The site features a typewriter animation that cycles through my different roles, smooth scrolling, and a contact form that actually works. I've also included a theme switcher because I know some people prefer dark mode.

## What I Built It With

- Next.js with TypeScript (for the performance and developer experience)
- Tailwind CSS (because writing custom CSS from scratch is exhausting)
- Framer Motion (for the smooth animations)
- Web3Forms (simple contact form solution)

## Live Site
